Where I got frustrated with javascript and had to take a break and move on for a bit. I dont know why it wont work. Then why the heck there is a blank spot in the first image i have no clue how the heck I did that so yea moving on for a bit.

Added the style to one side of the card so it we can give it the 3d transition

This is before the skew is added to the X axis just so you can get an idea of how much of a difference one single line of style can make.

You can see now with the the car:hoover style it will give the movement effect to the hard when hooverd over.

Added the style so when image is hovered over its going to blur some but where you can still see image thru it but it will give room for the text to appear on top of the image and just give it a nice effect.

Added an animation for the user for the name of the food when hovered over the name will make a smooth transition in and out.

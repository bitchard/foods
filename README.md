Where I got frustrated with javascript and had to take a break and move on for a bit. I dont know why it wont work. Then why the heck there is a blank spot in the first image i have no clue how the heck I did that so yea moving on for a bit.

Added the style to one side of the card so it we can give it the 3d transition

This is before the skew is added to the X axis just so you can get an idea of how much of a difference one single line of style can make.

You can see now with the the car:hoover style it will give the movement effect to the hard when hooverd over.
